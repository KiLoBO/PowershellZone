# PowershellZone
This repo holds my powershell scripts/snippits that I think are ready for public visiblity. They have been cleaned of org data.

## Notes/comments:
- We only have Powershell V5, so some things in this repo may act weirdly on a newer version. If we ever upgrade, the scripts here will be updated.
- Fuzzy find function was taken from: (Communary.Pasm)[https://github.com/gravejester/Communary.PASM]. We don't like installing external modules, so I grabbed the needed functions, checked them, and combined into 1 file.
- The super fancy ascii menu was taken from another repo, and then modified to actually work.
- Some variables and paths are hard coded in the functions or scripts. Make sure to check them. If I get time I will be modifying the code to use more variables for so that sharing and modifying to your needs is easier.
